I’m ready. Below is a phased, step-by-step implementation plan for Project Nexus. Each phase includes key tasks, deliverables, timelines, and security checkpoints in line with our secure-by-design principles.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Security Foundations (1–2 weeks)

1. Repository & Environment Initialization
   - Create central `project-nexus` GitHub org and repo (with branch protection rules).
   - Define folder structure:
     - `/tasks` (JSON task files)
     - `/docs`
     - `/scripts`
     - `/.github/workflows`
   - Initialize lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, etc.) for deterministic builds.

2. Secrets Management & Access Control
   - Provision a secrets store (e.g., DigitalOcean Secrets Manager).
   - Store API keys (GitHub, Slack, Factory.ai) and DB credentials securely.
   - Configure least-privilege IAM roles for CI runners and AI agents.

3. CI/CD & Infrastructure as Code
   - Set up GitHub Actions workflows:
     - Linting & security scans (SCA, SAST)
     - Test suites (unit, integration)
     - Deployment pipelines (dev→staging→prod)
   - Define infrastructure as code (Terraform/DOCTL) for DigitalOcean resources.

4. Security Hardening
   - Enforce HTTPS & HSTS in all environments.
   - Install and configure security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options).
   - Ensure debug modes disabled in production.

### Deliverables
- Initialized GitHub org, repos, workflows
- Secrets vault configured
- Basic security policies applied

## Phase 2: Task Management System (2–3 weeks)

1. JSON Task Schema & CRUD API
   - Define `tasks.json` schema:
     - `id`, `title`, `description`, `complexity`, `dependencies`, `status`, `repository`
     - Enforce JSON Schema validation server-side (AJV or equivalent).
   - Implement a minimal REST API (Node.js/Express or Dart Frog) with parameterized queries/ORM.
   - Secure endpoints with JWTs (RS256, `exp`, key rotation) and RBAC (Admin/Developer/Viewer).

2. GitHub Issues Integration
   - Build a webhook listener:
     - On PR merge → update task status to `Done`.
     - On issue creation/update → sync back to `tasks.json`.
   - Validate payloads and use a allow-list for repository names.

3. Circular Dependency Detection
   - Implement graph-traversal checks before dependency writes.
   - Return secure error messages on violations (no stack traces).

4. UI/CLI Client
   - Develop a React/Flutter web UI or CLI tool to:
     - List/filter tasks
     - Modify complexity/dependencies (with confirmations)
     - Trigger manual sync
   - Sanitize and encode all user input/output.

### Security Checkpoints
- Input validation on all API parameters
- Output encoding in UI to prevent XSS
- Audit logs for CRUD operations

## Phase 3: AI Agent Coordination (3–4 weeks)

1. Factory.ai Integration
   - Write an agent orchestration service:
     - Clone central repo, read `task_<ID>.txt`, clone target repo.
     - Assign tasks to Factory.ai agents with scoped API keys.
     - Validate each step and store agent logs.

2. Augment Agent & QA Hooks
   - Add a pre-merge review CI job invoking Augment’s API.
   - Enforce rule: no PR merges without QA approval flag.

3. Multi-Agent Workflow Engine
   - Design a state machine to:
     - Sequence tasks with dependencies
     - Allow parallel execution where safe
     - Handle retries and escalate failures via Slack alert

4. Secure Communication
   - Use mTLS or signed JWTs between services
   - Rate-limit agent endpoints

## Phase 4: Documentation Management (1–2 weeks)

1. Directory Strategy & Versioning
   - Centralize cross-cutting docs under `/docs`
   - Maintain repo-specific docs in each project; use Git submodules or a sync script.

2. Smart Links & Sync Script
   - Write a nightly cron job:
     - Crawl all markdown links
     - Check HTTP status codes or repo file existence
     - Report broken links via Slack
   - Use GitHub Actions for auto-commits of doc changes

3. AI-Generated Content Appender
   - On code change events, invoke CodeGuide.dev API
   - Append summaries to relevant doc sections (sanitize HTML)

### Security & Privacy
- Validate external content before insertion
- Enforce least privilege for doc-writing bot

## Phase 5: Team Coordination & Notifications (1–2 weeks)

1. Slack Integration
   - Create Slack App with granular scopes (webhooks, chat:write)
   - Implement notification service:
     - `[GitHub] Task #XX completed in [Repo] by [Actor]`
     - `[Slack] Deployment successful for [Repo]`
   - Rate-limit and sanitize message payloads

2. GitHub Workflows for Cross-Repo Actions
   - Use `repository_dispatch` and `workflow_run` to chain multi-repo tasks
   - Ensure token usage follows least-privilege (fine-grained PATs)

3. Role Definitions
   - Map GitHub teams/Slack channels to roles:
     - Admin: merge, config changes
     - Developer: PR creation, task updates
     - Viewer: read-only dashboards

## Phase 6: Monitoring, Reporting & Alerting (1 week)

1. DigitalOcean Metrics
   - Enable DO Monitoring for CPU (>80%), memory (>75%), uptime
   - Configure alert policies → Slack `#alerts`

2. Agent Performance Dashboards
   - Build Grafana/Metabase dashboards:
     - Task throughput
     - Agent success/failure rates
   - Export data from central API securely

3. Error Handling & Escalation
   - Implement exponential back-off and retries
   - On repeated failures, escalate via high-priority Slack alert

## Phase 7: Final Security Review & Compliance (1 week)

1. Penetration Testing & SCA
   - Run SAST/SCA scans in CI pipelines
   - Remediate critical/high CVEs
   - Perform internal pentest or third-party audit

2. GDPR/CCPA Audit
   - Identify PII in storage and logs
   - Implement data masking and retention policies

3. Documentation & Handoff
   - Produce an operations runbook covering:
     - Onboarding/offboarding
     - Secret rotation
     - Incident response procedures
