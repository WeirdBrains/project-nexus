      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the coordination of the image processing pipeline across moire, backend, and mandible repositories into subtasks such as requirements gathering, interface definition, workflow mapping, communication protocol setup, integration testing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Coordinating an image processing pipeline across multiple repositories involves aligning workflows, defining interfaces, and ensuring robust communication between systems. This requires significant planning, integration, and testing, making it a high-complexity task that benefits from multiple focused subtasks."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand documentation into subtasks such as system overview, onboarding guide, usage instructions, troubleshooting, and maintenance/update procedures.",
      "reasoning": "Comprehensive documentation for onboarding and system usage requires gathering information from multiple sources, structuring content for clarity, and ensuring it is accessible and maintainable. While not as technically complex as integration, it is still a multi-faceted task."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the setup into subtasks such as requirements analysis, workflow design, implementation of sync scripts, testing across repositories, and monitoring/logging setup.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing automated synchronization with GitHub Actions across repositories involves workflow design, scripting, and robust testing to ensure reliability, making it moderately high in complexity."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as Slack app/webhook setup, notification workflow design, integration with repositories, and testing/validation.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up Slack notifications is a well-defined integration task but requires careful configuration and testing to ensure notifications are timely and accurate across repositories."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks such as project-nexus configuration, repository integration (backend, sso_backend, accounts, moire, mandible), production branch issue resolution, dependency mapping, permissions setup, end-to-end testing, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Configuring a master coordinator for multiple repositories and resolving production issues is highly complex, involving deep integration, dependency management, and system-wide testing."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as test task creation, dependency setup, status check validation, branch integration testing, Slack notification testing, conflict scenario testing, synchronization validation, and issue documentation.",
      "reasoning": "Testing a cross-repository coordination system is complex due to the need to validate multiple integration points, handle edge cases, and ensure consistent behavior across all repositories."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks such as test environment setup, mock scenario definition, backend implementation, accounts implementation, integration testing, logging/monitoring, and documentation/cleanup.",
      "reasoning": "Integration testing between backend and accounts repositories involves environment setup, implementation, and thorough testing, requiring coordination but with a narrower scope than full cross-repo coordination."

      "expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks such as documentation environment setup, backend API documentation, sso_backend API documentation, cross-service interaction documentation, review/validation, and publication.",
      "reasoning": "Creating comprehensive API documentation across services is moderately complex, requiring detailed technical writing, validation, and coordination between teams, but is less complex than system integration tasks."
