# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Analytics & Business Intelligence Dashboard
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive analytics and business intelligence dashboard to track user behavior, conversion funnels, revenue metrics, cohort analysis, retention, and product-market fit indicators.
# Details:
Integrate multiple data sources (application backend, payment systems, user engagement trackers) to collect relevant metrics. Design and implement a scalable data pipeline for ingesting, transforming, and storing analytics data. Build backend APIs to expose aggregated metrics such as user engagement, conversion funnels, cohort retention, and revenue analytics. Develop a user-friendly, customizable dashboard UI featuring interactive charts, graphs, heat maps, and real-time data updates. Ensure the dashboard supports drill-downs, segmentation, and filtering by cohort, time period, and user attributes. Incorporate business intelligence features for actionable insights, including trend analysis and anomaly detection. Prioritize data privacy and security, especially for sensitive user and revenue data. Align dashboard KPIs with business goals and allow for future extensibility as new metrics or data sources are required.

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate data pipeline accuracy by comparing dashboard metrics with raw data sources. 2. Test dashboard UI for usability, responsiveness, and correct visualization of all tracked metrics. 3. Simulate user flows to ensure conversion funnels and cohort analyses reflect actual user behavior. 4. Verify real-time updates and filtering functionality. 5. Conduct security and privacy audits on analytics data handling. 6. Solicit stakeholder feedback to confirm dashboard aligns with business objectives and supports data-driven decision making.
