# Test Strategy:
## Test Strategy

### 1. Pre-Demo Environment Validation
- Verify demo environment is properly configured:
  ```bash
  # Run automated environment validation
  ./scripts/validate-demo-env.sh --env=demo-hpu
  
  # Verify core sample data is loaded correctly
  node scripts/verify-demo-data.js --template=dental-education-basic
  ```
- Test all user accounts and ensure proper permissions:
  - Login as each role type and verify access controls
  - Test messaging and collaboration features between different roles
  - Verify group functionality is working correctly

### 2. Core Functionality Testing
- Execute test script covering key demo scenarios:
  - Send and receive messages between users
  - Create and collaborate on shared documents
  - Test user management and group creation
  - Verify notification system functionality
- Document any workarounds needed for features not yet in production

### 3. Performance Testing
- Simulate concurrent users for core functionality:
  ```bash
  # Run focused load test with 25 simulated users
  ./scripts/load-test.sh --env=demo-hpu --users=25 --duration=5m --features=core
  ```
- Verify response times remain under 500ms for messaging and collaboration features
- Test on the actual network that will be used for the demo

### 4. Presentation Materials Review
- Conduct peer review of all presentation materials:
  - Slide deck accuracy and messaging
  - HIPAA compliance roadmap clarity
  - Value proposition alignment with dental education needs
  - Technical overview accuracy
- Incorporate feedback and revise as needed

### 5. Demo Rehearsal Assessment
- Record rehearsal sessions and review for:
  - Timing (ensure demo fits within allocated timeframe)
  - Clarity of explanations about core functionality
  - Effective communication of HIPAA compliance status
  - Handling of potential questions about educational use cases
- Have technical team members attempt to "break" the core features to identify edge cases

### 6. Contingency Planning
- Create backup plans for potential demo issues:
  - Local backup of demo environment in case of connectivity issues
  - Screenshots/videos of key features as fallback
  - Prepared explanations for any known limitations
- Assign team members specific roles during demo (presenter, technical support, note-taker)
