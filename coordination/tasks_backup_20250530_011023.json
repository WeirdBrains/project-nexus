      "details": "## Phase 1: Immediate Error Fix (COMPLETED)\n1. ✅ Fixed Chat Provider Error Handling: Updated chat_providers.dart to return AsyncError instead of throwing exception when chat not found\n2. ✅ Added Chat Not Available UI: Created comprehensive ChatNotAvailableView component with variants (ChatDeletedView, ChatHiddenView, GroupLeftView)\n3. ✅ Updated Messages View: Now gracefully handles missing chats with ChatNotAvailableView instead of ErrorScreen\n4. ✅ Updated Chat Details Page: Proper fallback UI when chat not found\n5. ✅ Updated Edit Chat Page: Clean error handling for unavailable chats\n6. ✅ Navigation Safety: All chat-related views now handle missing chats without crashes\n\n## Phase 2: Database Schema Changes\n1. Modify the chat_rooms table to support soft delete:\n```sql\nALTER TABLE chat_rooms ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL;\nALTER TABLE chat_rooms ADD COLUMN deleted_by VARCHAR(255) NULL;\n```\n\n2. Create a new user_chat_visibility table for per-user hiding:\n```sql\nCREATE TABLE user_chat_visibility (\n  id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,\n  user_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  chat_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,\n  hidden_at TIMESTAMP NULL,\n  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP\n);\n```\n\n## Phase 3: API and Frontend Implementation\n1. Create a new API endpoint for hiding chats:\n```\nPUT /chat/chat_rooms/{id}/hide\n```\n\n2. Update the frontend ChatController to use hide instead of delete:\n```dart\nFuture<bool> hideChat(String chatId) async {\n  try {\n    final response = await _chatRepository.hideChat(chatId);\n    if (response.success) {\n      // Remove from local list but preserve data\n      _removeFromLocalList(chatId);\n      return true;\n    }\n    return false;\n  } catch (e) {\n    _logger.error('Failed to hide chat', e);\n    return false;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n3. Implement different behaviors for one-to-one vs group chats:\n   - One-to-one: Hide for current user only\n   - Group chats: Option to leave group or hide conversation\n\n4. Update chat list queries to filter based on visibility settings\n\n## URGENT: HPU Demo Requirements\n- Complete Phases 2-3 by Saturday for Tuesday's HPU demo\n- Ensure zero chat deletion crashes during the demo\n- Focus on implementing the user_chat_visibility table and hide API endpoint\n- Test thoroughly with all chat scenarios (one-to-one, group chats)",
      "testStrategy": "1. Verify database schema changes correctly implement soft delete\n2. Test hiding a chat for one user and verify it remains visible for others\n3. Test different scenarios: one-to-one chat hiding vs group chat hiding\n4. Verify that hidden chats can be restored if needed\n5. Test error handling when accessing a hidden chat\n   - Verify the ChatNotAvailableView components display correctly in all scenarios\n   - Confirm that the appropriate variant (ChatDeletedView, ChatHiddenView, GroupLeftView) is shown\n6. Verify that message history is preserved when a chat is hidden\n7. Performance test to ensure chat list queries remain efficient with visibility filtering\n8. Regression test to ensure Phase 1 error handling continues to work with new implementation\n9. Pre-demo validation: Run through all chat deletion/hiding scenarios that might occur during the HPU demo\n10. Create a demo script with specific test cases to verify during final pre-demo check",

Audit all image-related components in the chat interface:\n   - ImageMessageBubble\n   - ImagePickerModal\n   - ImageCropperView\n   - ImagePreviewScreen\n2. Identify specific causes of layout shifts:\n   ```dart\n   // Check for missing size constraints in image containers\n   Container(\n     width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.7, // Add fixed width\n     constraints: BoxConstraints(maxHeight: 300), // Add max height\n     child: ImageMessageWidget(message: message),\n   )\n   ```\n3. Add placeholder dimensions during image loading:\n   ```dart\n   CachedNetworkImage(\n     imageUrl: message.imageUrl,\n     placeholder: (context, url) => Container(\n       width: message.imageWidth ?? 200,\n       height: message.imageHeight ?? 200,\n       color: Colors.grey[300],\n     ),\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Phase 2: Modal Fixes (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n1. Refactor ImagePickerModal to use ModalBottomSheet instead of full-screen takeover:\n   ```dart\n   showModalBottomSheet(\n     context: context,\n     isScrollControlled: true,\n     backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,\n     builder: (context) => ImagePickerBottomSheet(),\n   );\n   ```\n2. Implement proper modal dismissal handling:\n   ```dart\n   // Add WillPopScope to handle back button properly\n   WillPopScope(\n     onWillPop: () async {\n       // Clean up resources before dismissing\n       await imagePickerController.dispose();\n       return true;\n     },\n     child: ImagePickerBottomSheet(),\n   )\n   ```\n3. Fix z-index issues with modals appearing behind other UI elements\n\n### Phase 3: Polling Enhancement\n1. Modify the PollingService to pause image uploads during app state changes:\n   ```dart\n   void _handleAppLifecycleChange(AppLifecycleState state) {\n     if (state == AppLifecycleState.paused) {\n       _pauseActiveImageUploads();\n     } else if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {\n       _resumeActiveImageUploads();\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n2. Implement proper cleanup of image resources when chat view is disposed\n\n### Phase 4: Cropping Fixes (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n1. Fix the image cropper to maintain aspect ratio correctly:\n   ```dart\n   ImageCropper(\n     aspectRatio: CropAspectRatio(ratioX: 1, ratioY: 1),\n     cropStyle: CropStyle.rectangle,\n     compressQuality: 85, // Reduce file size while maintaining quality\n   )\n   ```\n2. Add proper error handling for corrupted images or failed cropping operations\n3. Implement image size validation before upload to prevent oversized images\n\n### Phase 5: Optimistic UI (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n1. Implement optimistic image message rendering:\n   ```dart\n   // Show local image immediately while uploading\n   if (message.status == 'sending' && message.localImagePath != null) {\n     return Image.file(File(message.localImagePath));\n   } else {\n     return CachedNetworkImage(imageUrl: message.imageUrl);\n   }\n   ```\n2. Add smooth transitions between local and uploaded images\n3. Implement proper fallback UI for failed uploads\n\n### Phase 6: Platform Optimization\n1. Add platform-specific image handling for iOS and Android:\n   ```dart\n   if (Platform.isIOS) {\n     // Use iOS-specific image picker options\n     final pickedFile = await ImagePicker().pickImage(\n       source: ImageSource.gallery,\n       imageQuality: 85,\n     );\n   } else {\n     // Use Android-specific image picker options\n     final pickedFile = await ImagePicker().pickImage(\n       source: ImageSource.gallery,\n       imageQuality: 80,\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n2. Optimize image caching strategy to reduce memory usage\n3. Implement proper image compression before upload to reduce bandwidth usage\n\n## Healthcare Demo Considerations\n1. Ensure image sharing appears professional and reliable for healthcare context\n2. Prioritize stability over additional features for the Tuesday demo\n3. Focus on making the core image sharing workflow flawless\n4. Test with realistic healthcare image examples (e.g., document scans, medical diagrams)",
      "testStrategy": "## Testing Strategy\n\n### 1. UI Stability Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n- Create a test suite specifically for layout stability:\n  ```dart\n  testWidgets('Image message does not cause layout shifts', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    // Arrange: Set up chat with image messages\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ChatScreen()));\n    \n    // Act: Scroll through messages with images\n    await tester.drag(find.byType(ListView), const Offset(0, -500));\n    await tester.pump();\n    \n    // Assert: Measure and verify no layout shifts occurred\n    final initialLayout = tester.getRect(find.byType(MessageBubble).first);\n    await tester.pump(Duration(milliseconds: 500));\n    final finalLayout = tester.getRect(find.byType(MessageBubble).first);\n    expect(initialLayout, equals(finalLayout));\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 2.

State Management Testing\n- Test image upload state transitions:\n  ```dart\n  test('Image message transitions through correct states during upload', () async {\n    // Arrange: Set up mock image upload\n    final controller = ImageMessageController();\n    final mockImage = File('test/resources/test_image.jpg');\n    \n    // Act: Start upload\n    final message = await controller.sendImage(mockImage);\n    \n    // Assert: Verify initial state\n    expect(message.status, equals('sending'));\n    expect(message.localImagePath, isNotNull);\n    \n    // Act: Complete upload\n    await completeUpload(message);\n    \n    // Assert: Verify final state\n    expect(message.status, equals('sent'));\n    expect(message.imageUrl, isNotNull);\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 5. Performance Testing\n- Measure memory usage during image operations:\n  ```dart\n  test('Image handling does not cause memory leaks', () async {\n    // Arrange: Set up memory tracking\n    final memoryBefore = await getApplicationMemoryUsage();\n    \n    // Act: Perform multiple image operations\n    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {\n      await pickAndProcessImage();\n    }\n    \n    // Force garbage collection\n    await triggerGC();\n    \n    // Assert: Verify memory usage is within acceptable limits\n    final memoryAfter = await getApplicationMemoryUsage();\n    expect(memoryAfter - memoryBefore, lessThan(10 * 1024 * 1024)); // Less than 10MB increase\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 6. Integration Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n- End-to-end test of image messaging flow:\n  ```dart\n  testWidgets('Complete image messaging flow works correctly', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    // Arrange: Set up chat screen with mock services\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ChatScreen()));\n    \n    // Act: Select image\n    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.image));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Gallery'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Act: Crop image\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Crop'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Done'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Act: Send image\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Send'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Assert: Verify image appears in chat\n    expect(find.byType(ImageMessageBubble), findsOneWidget);\n    \n    // Act: Wait for upload to complete\n    await tester.pump(Duration(seconds: 2));\n    \n    // Assert: Verify message status updated correctly\n    final messageBubble = find.byType(ImageMessageBubble);\n    expect(tester.widget<ImageMessageBubble>(messageBubble).message.status, equals('sent'));\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 7. Cross-Platform Testing\n- Test on both iOS and Android devices to verify platform-specific behavior\n- Verify correct handling of different image formats (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, etc.)\n- Test with various device screen sizes to ensure responsive layout\n\n### 8. Healthcare Demo Validation (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n- Test with realistic healthcare document images\n- Verify professional appearance and reliability of image sharing\n- Conduct a full demo rehearsal before Tuesday",

Implement feed load time optimization instead of smart polling for feed updates\n2. Implement additional performance optimizations\n3. Add monitoring and analytics for polling behavior\n\n## Feed Optimization Decision\n\nAfter analysis, we've determined that smart polling for the feed is not cost-effective due to:\n- Low time sensitivity of feed content\n- Very high API call costs (60+ calls per poll)\n- Better alternatives exist (pull-to-refresh, app-resume refresh)\n\nInstead, we'll focus on feed load time optimization which will provide much better ROI.",

      "details": "## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: UI Safety Check (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n1. Audit all image-related components in the chat interface:\n   - ImageMessageBubble\n   - ImagePickerModal\n   - ImageCropperView\n   - ImagePreviewScreen\n2. Identify specific causes of layout shifts:\n   ```dart\n   // Check for missing size constraints in image containers\n   Container(\n     width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.7, // Add fixed width\n     constraints: BoxConstraints(maxHeight: 300), // Add max height\n     child: ImageMessageWidget(message: message),\n   )\n   ```\n3. Add placeholder dimensions during image loading:\n   ```dart\n   CachedNetworkImage(\n     imageUrl: message.imageUrl,\n     placeholder: (context, url) => Container(\n       width: message.imageWidth ?? 200,\n       height: message.imageHeight ?? 200,\n       color: Colors.grey[300],\n     ),\n   )\n   ```\n\n### Phase 2: Modal Fixes (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n1. Refactor ImagePickerModal to use ModalBottomSheet instead of full-screen takeover:\n   ```dart\n   showModalBottomSheet(\n     context: context,\n     isScrollControlled: true,\n     backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,\n     builder: (context) => ImagePickerBottomSheet(),\n   );\n   ```\n2. Implement proper modal dismissal handling:\n   ```dart\n   // Add WillPopScope to handle back button properly\n   WillPopScope(\n     onWillPop: () async {\n       // Clean up resources before dismissing\n       await imagePickerController.dispose();\n       return true;\n     },\n     child: ImagePickerBottomSheet(),\n   )\n   ```\n3. Fix z-index issues with modals appearing behind other UI elements\n\n### Phase 3: Polling Enhancement\n1. Modify the PollingService to pause image uploads during app state changes:\n   ```dart\n   void _handleAppLifecycleChange(AppLifecycleState state) {\n     if (state == AppLifecycleState.paused) {\n       _pauseActiveImageUploads();\n     } else if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {\n       _resumeActiveImageUploads();\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n2. Implement proper cleanup of image resources when chat view is disposed\n\n### Phase 4: Cropping Fixes (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n1. Fix the image cropper to maintain aspect ratio correctly:\n   ```dart\n   ImageCropper(\n     aspectRatio: CropAspectRatio(ratioX: 1, ratioY: 1),\n     cropStyle: CropStyle.rectangle,\n     compressQuality: 85, // Reduce file size while maintaining quality\n   )\n   ```\n2. Add proper error handling for corrupted images or failed cropping operations\n3. Implement image size validation before upload to prevent oversized images\n\n### Phase 5: Optimistic UI (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n1. Implement optimistic image message rendering:\n   ```dart\n   // Show local image immediately while uploading\n   if (message.status == 'sending' && message.localImagePath != null) {\n     return Image.file(File(message.localImagePath));\n   } else {\n     return CachedNetworkImage(imageUrl: message.imageUrl);\n   }\n   ```\n2. Add smooth transitions between local and uploaded images\n3. Implement proper fallback UI for failed uploads\n\n### Phase 6: Platform Optimization\n1. Add platform-specific image handling for iOS and Android:\n   ```dart\n   if (Platform.isIOS) {\n     // Use iOS-specific image picker options\n     final pickedFile = await ImagePicker().pickImage(\n       source: ImageSource.gallery,\n       imageQuality: 85,\n     );\n   } else {\n     // Use Android-specific image picker options\n     final pickedFile = await ImagePicker().pickImage(\n       source: ImageSource.gallery,\n       imageQuality: 80,\n     );\n   }\n   ```\n2. Optimize image caching strategy to reduce memory usage\n3. Implement proper image compression before upload to reduce bandwidth usage\n\n## Healthcare Demo Considerations\n1. Ensure image sharing appears professional and reliable for healthcare context\n2. Prioritize stability over additional features for the Tuesday demo\n3. Focus on making the core image sharing workflow flawless\n4. Test with realistic healthcare image examples (e.g., document scans, medical diagrams)",
      "testStrategy": "## Testing Strategy\n\n### 1. UI Stability Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n- Create a test suite specifically for layout stability:\n  ```dart\n  testWidgets('Image message does not cause layout shifts', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    // Arrange: Set up chat with image messages\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ChatScreen()));\n    \n    // Act: Scroll through messages with images\n    await tester.drag(find.byType(ListView), const Offset(0, -500));\n    await tester.pump();\n    \n    // Assert: Measure and verify no layout shifts occurred\n    final initialLayout = tester.getRect(find.byType(MessageBubble).first);\n    await tester.pump(Duration(milliseconds: 500));\n    final finalLayout = tester.getRect(find.byType(MessageBubble).first);\n    expect(initialLayout, equals(finalLayout));\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 2. Modal Behavior Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n- Test modal appearance and dismissal:\n  ```dart\n  testWidgets('Image picker modal appears and dismisses correctly', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    // Arrange: Set up chat screen\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ChatScreen()));\n    \n    // Act: Tap image attachment button\n    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.image));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Assert: Verify modal is visible\n    expect(find.byType(ImagePickerBottomSheet), findsOneWidget);\n    \n    // Act: Dismiss modal\n    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.close));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Assert: Verify modal is dismissed\n    expect(find.byType(ImagePickerBottomSheet), findsNothing);\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 3. Cropping Functionality Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n- Test image cropping with various aspect ratios:\n  ```dart\n  testWidgets('Image cropper maintains selected aspect ratio', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    // Arrange: Set up cropper with test image\n    final testImage = createTestImage(800, 600);\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ImageCropperView(image: testImage)));\n    \n    // Act: Select 1:1 aspect ratio\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Square'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Assert: Verify crop box has correct aspect ratio\n    final cropBox = tester.getRect(find.byType(CropBox));\n    expect(cropBox.width / cropBox.height, closeTo(1.0, 0.01));\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 4. State Management Testing\n- Test image upload state transitions:\n  ```dart\n  test('Image message transitions through correct states during upload', () async {\n    // Arrange: Set up mock image upload\n    final controller = ImageMessageController();\n    final mockImage = File('test/resources/test_image.jpg');\n    \n    // Act: Start upload\n    final message = await controller.sendImage(mockImage);\n    \n    // Assert: Verify initial state\n    expect(message.status, equals('sending'));\n    expect(message.localImagePath, isNotNull);\n    \n    // Act: Complete upload\n    await completeUpload(message);\n    \n    // Assert: Verify final state\n    expect(message.status, equals('sent'));\n    expect(message.imageUrl, isNotNull);\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 5. Performance Testing\n- Measure memory usage during image operations:\n  ```dart\n  test('Image handling does not cause memory leaks', () async {\n    // Arrange: Set up memory tracking\n    final memoryBefore = await getApplicationMemoryUsage();\n    \n    // Act: Perform multiple image operations\n    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {\n      await pickAndProcessImage();\n    }\n    \n    // Force garbage collection\n    await triggerGC();\n    \n    // Assert: Verify memory usage is within acceptable limits\n    final memoryAfter = await getApplicationMemoryUsage();\n    expect(memoryAfter - memoryBefore, lessThan(10 * 1024 * 1024)); // Less than 10MB increase\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 6. Integration Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n- End-to-end test of image messaging flow:\n  ```dart\n  testWidgets('Complete image messaging flow works correctly', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    // Arrange: Set up chat screen with mock services\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ChatScreen()));\n    \n    // Act: Select image\n    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.image));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Gallery'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Act: Crop image\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Crop'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Done'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Act: Send image\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Send'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Assert: Verify image appears in chat\n    expect(find.byType(ImageMessageBubble), findsOneWidget);\n    \n    // Act: Wait for upload to complete\n    await tester.pump(Duration(seconds: 2));\n    \n    // Assert: Verify message status updated correctly\n    final messageBubble = find.byType(ImageMessageBubble);\n    expect(tester.widget<ImageMessageBubble>(messageBubble).message.status, equals('sent'));\n  });\n  ```\n\n### 7. Cross-Platform Testing\n- Test on both iOS and Android devices to verify platform-specific behavior\n- Verify correct handling of different image formats (JPEG, PNG, HEIC, etc.)\n- Test with various device screen sizes to ensure responsive layout\n\n### 8. Healthcare Demo Validation (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)\n- Test with realistic healthcare document images\n- Verify professional appearance and reliability of image sharing\n- Conduct a full demo rehearsal before Tuesday",

      "description": "Replace hash-based routing (#/chat/123) with clean path-based routing (/chat/123) to improve SEO, user experience, and social media sharing capabilities.",
      "details": "## Implementation Plan\n\n### 1. Flutter Code Changes\n1. Modify `main.dart` to enable path URL strategy:\n```dart\nimport 'package:flutter/material.dart';\nimport 'package:flutter_web_plugins/flutter_web_plugins.dart';\n\nvoid main() {\n  // Enable path-based routing instead of hash-based\n  setUrlStrategy(PathUrlStrategy());\n  \n  runApp(MyApp());\n}\n```\n\n2. Update route generation to support clean URLs:\n```dart\nGoRouter router = GoRouter(\n  routes: [\n    GoRoute(\n      path: '/chat/:chatId',\n      builder: (context, state) => ChatScreen(\n        chatId: state.params['chatId']!,\n      ),\n    ),\n    // Other routes...\n  ],\n);\n```\n\n3. Add SEO meta tags for individual pages:\n```dart\n// Create a MetaTagsService\nclass MetaTagsService {\n  static void updateMetaTags({\n    required String title,\n    required String description,\n    String? imageUrl,\n    String? canonicalUrl,\n  }) {\n    if (kIsWeb) {\n      document.title = title;\n      \n      // Update meta tags\n      _updateMetaTag('description', description);\n      \n      // Open Graph tags for social sharing\n      _updateMetaTag('og:title', title);\n      _updateMetaTag('og:description', description);\n      if (imageUrl != null) _updateMetaTag('og:image', imageUrl);\n      if (canonicalUrl != null) _updateMetaTag('og:url', canonicalUrl);\n      \n      // Twitter Card tags\n      _updateMetaTag('twitter:card', 'summary_large_image');\n      _updateMetaTag('twitter:title', title);\n      _updateMetaTag('twitter:description', description);\n      if (imageUrl != null) _updateMetaTag('twitter:image', imageUrl);\n    }\n  }\n  \n  static void _updateMetaTag(String property, String content) {\n    // Implementation to update or create meta tags in the document head\n  }\n}\n```\n\n4. Implement dynamic meta tag updates for each route:\n```dart\nclass ChatScreen extends StatefulWidget {\n  final String chatId;\n  \n  @override\n  _ChatScreenState createState() => _ChatScreenState();\n}\n\nclass _ChatScreenState extends State<ChatScreen> {\n  @override\n  void initState() {\n    super.initState();\n    _updateMetaTags();\n  }\n  \n  Future<void> _updateMetaTags() async {\n    // Fetch chat details\n    final chat = await ChatService.getChatById(widget.chatId);\n    \n    // Update meta tags for this specific chat\n    MetaTagsService.updateMetaTags(\n      title: 'Chat with ${chat.otherParticipant.name}',\n      description: 'Continue your conversation with ${chat.otherParticipant.name}',\n      imageUrl: chat.otherParticipant.profileImage,\n      canonicalUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/chat/${widget.chatId}',\n    );\n  }\n  \n  // Rest of the implementation...\n}\n```\n\n### 2. DigitalOcean App Platform Configuration\n1. Configure Custom Pages in DigitalOcean App Platform:\n   - Navigate to App Platform > Your App > Settings > Custom Pages\n   - Add a catchall route configuration:\n     - Source Path: `/*`\n     - Destination Path: `/index.html`\n   - This ensures all routes are directed to the Flutter app entry point\n\n2. Update build and deploy scripts to ensure proper configuration:\n```yaml\n# In your CI/CD pipeline\ndeploy:\n  script:\n    - flutter build web --release\n    - doctl apps update $APP_ID --spec app-spec.yaml\n    # Ensure custom pages configuration is applied\n    - doctl apps update-custom-domain $APP_ID --spec custom-domain-spec.yaml\n```\n\n### 3. Coordinated Deployment Strategy\n1. Create a deployment checklist:\n   - Build Flutter web app with path URL strategy enabled\n   - Deploy updated code to staging environment\n   - Configure DigitalOcean App Platform custom pages\n   - Verify all routes work correctly in staging\n   - Deploy to production with minimal downtime\n\n2. Implement a fallback mechanism during transition:\n```dart\n// In router configuration, temporarily handle both path and hash routes\nGoRouter router = GoRouter(\n  routes: [\n    GoRoute(\n      path: '/chat/:chatId',\n      builder: (context, state) => ChatScreen(\n        chatId: state.params['chatId']!,\n      ),\n    ),\n    // Legacy hash route support during transition\n    GoRoute(\n      path: '/#/chat/:chatId',\n      redirect: (context, state) => '/chat/${state.params['chatId']}',\n    ),\n  ],\n);\n```\n\n### 4. Analytics Integration\n1. Update analytics tracking to work with path-based URLs:\n```dart\nvoid logPageView(BuildContext context, String screenName) {\n  final String currentPath = GoRouterState.of(context).location;\n  \n  // Log page view to analytics\n  AnalyticsService.logEvent(\n    'page_view',\n    parameters: {\n      'screen_name': screenName,\n      'path': currentPath,\n    },\n  );\n}\n```\n\n### 5. Testing and Validation\n1. Create comprehensive tests for URL handling:\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  testWidgets('Path-based routing works correctly', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());\n    \n    // Navigate to a chat using path-based URL\n    await navigateTo(tester, '/chat/123');\n    \n    // Verify correct screen is shown\n    expect(find.byType(ChatScreen), findsOneWidget);\n    expect(find.text('Chat ID: 123'), findsOneWidget);\n  });\n}\n```",
      "testStrategy": "## Test Strategy\n\n### 1. Unit Tests\n1. Test URL strategy configuration:\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  test('URL strategy is set to PathUrlStrategy', () {\n    // Mock the web plugins\n    final mockWebPlugins = MockFlutterWebPlugins();\n    \n    // Run the app initialization\n    initializeApp();\n    \n    // Verify PathUrlStrategy was set\n    verify(mockWebPlugins.setUrlStrategy(any(that: isA<PathUrlStrategy>()))).called(1);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n2. Test route generation and parameter extraction:\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  testWidgets('Route parameters are correctly extracted', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());\n    \n    // Navigate to a chat route\n    await navigateTo(tester, '/chat/123');\n    \n    // Verify parameters are extracted correctly\n    final context = tester.element(find.byType(ChatScreen));\n    final params = GoRouterState.of(context).params;\n    expect(params['chatId'], equals('123'));\n  });\n}\n```\n\n3. Test meta tag service:\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  test('Meta tags are correctly updated', () {\n    // Mock the document\n    final mockDocument = MockHtmlDocument();\n    \n    // Call the service\n    MetaTagsService.updateMetaTags(\n      title: 'Test Title',\n      description: 'Test Description',\n      imageUrl: 'https://example.com/image.jpg',\n      canonicalUrl: 'https://example.com/chat/123',\n    );\n    \n    // Verify document title was updated\n    verify(mockDocument.title = 'Test Title').called(1);\n    \n    // Verify meta tags were updated\n    verify(mockDocument.updateMetaTag('description', 'Test Description')).called(1);\n    verify(mockDocument.updateMetaTag('og:title', 'Test Title')).called(1);\n    // Additional verifications...\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Integration Tests\n1. Test navigation flows with path-based URLs:\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  IntegrationTestWidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();\n  \n  testWidgets('Complete navigation flow with path-based URLs', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp());\n    \n    // Navigate to chat list\n    await navigateTo(tester, '/chats');\n    expect(find.byType(ChatListScreen), findsOneWidget);\n    \n    // Tap on a chat to navigate to detail\n    await tester.tap(find.text('Test User'));\n    await tester.pumpAndSettle();\n    \n    // Verify URL changed to path-based format\n    final context = tester.element(find.byType(ChatScreen));\n    final location = GoRouterState.of(context).location;\n    expect(location, startsWith('/chat/'));\n    expect(location, isNot(contains('#')));\n  });\n}\n```\n\n2. Test deep linking:\n```dart\nvoid main() {\n  testWidgets('Deep linking works with path-based URLs', (WidgetTester tester) async {\n    // Initialize app with a specific initial route\n    await tester.pumpWidget(MyApp(initialRoute: '/chat/123'));\n    \n    // Verify correct screen is shown immediately\n    expect(find.byType(ChatScreen), findsOneWidget);\n    expect(find.text('Chat ID: 123'), findsOneWidget);\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Browser Testing\n1. Manual browser testing checklist:\n   - Test direct URL entry in browser address bar\n   - Test browser back/forward navigation\n   - Test page refresh at different routes\n   - Test bookmarking and returning to bookmarked pages\n   - Verify URL format in address bar (no hash symbols)\n\n2. Cross-browser testing matrix:\n   - Chrome (latest)\n   - Firefox (latest)\n   - Safari (latest)\n   - Edge (latest)\n   - Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)\n\n### 4. SEO Verification\n1. Use Lighthouse to verify SEO scores:\n   - Run Lighthouse audit on key pages\n   - Verify \"Crawlable Links\" passes\n   - Verify meta tags are correctly rendered\n\n2. Use Google Search Console URL inspection:\n   - Submit key URLs for inspection\n   - Verify Google can render the page correctly\n   - Check for any crawling errors\n\n### 5. Social Media Sharing Tests\n1. Test Open Graph tag rendering:\n   - Use Facebook Sharing Debugger (https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)\n   - Use Twitter Card Validator (https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)\n   - Verify preview images, titles, and descriptions appear correctly\n\n2. Manual sharing tests:\n   - Share URLs to various platforms (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)\n   - Verify preview content appears correctly\n   - Verify clicking shared links navigates to correct page\n\n### 6. Deployment Verification\n1. Pre-deployment checklist:\n   - Verify all tests pass in staging environment\n   - Confirm DigitalOcean App Platform configuration is ready\n\n2. Post-deployment verification:\n   - Verify direct URL access works for all routes\n   - Test navigation between pages\n   - Verify analytics is tracking page views correctly\n   - Check server logs for any 404 errors",

Implement feed load time optimization instead of smart polling for feed updates\n2. Implement additional performance optimizations\n3. Add monitoring and analytics for polling behavior\n\n## Feed Optimization Decision\n\nAfter analysis, we've determined that smart polling for the feed is not cost-effective due to:\n- Low time sensitivity of feed content\n- Very high API call costs (60+ calls per poll)\n- Better alternatives exist (pull-to-refresh, app-resume refresh)\n\nInstead, we'll focus on feed load time optimization which will provide much better ROI.",

Implement structured error logging for message operations:\n```dart\nvoid logMessageError(String operation, String messageId, dynamic error) {\n  Sentry.captureEvent(\n    SentryEvent(\n      level: SentryLevel.error,\n      message: SentryMessage('Message operation failed'),\n      tags: {\n        'operation': operation,\n        'messageId': messageId,\n      },\n    ),\n  );\n}\n```\n\n3. Create user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios:\n   - Network connectivity issues\n   - Server errors\n   - Permission problems\n   - Timeout errors\n\n4. Implement graceful degradation for API failures:\n   - Offline mode with cached messages\n   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff\n   - Fallback to older messages when new ones can't be fetched\n\n5. Add monitoring for key metrics:\n   - Message delivery success rate\n   - API response times\n   - Error frequency by type\n   - User-reported issues\n\n6. Create a dashboard for real-time monitoring of messaging system health",
