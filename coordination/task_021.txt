# Task ID: 21
# Title: Infrastructure Cost Analysis
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Analyze current DigitalOcean infrastructure usage patterns, database utilization, and app resource consumption to identify cost optimization opportunities.
# Details:
## Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Collection
1. Use mandible-dev and mandible-prod MCP tools to gather metrics:
```bash
# Connect to production environment
ssh user@mandible-prod-server

# Collect database metrics
pg_stat_statements_reset(); # Reset statistics
# Wait for 24-48 hours to collect representative data
psql -c "SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC LIMIT 50;" > db_query_stats.csv

# Collect resource usage metrics
docker stats --no-stream > container_stats.txt
```

2. Extract DigitalOcean billing data:
   - Use DO API to pull detailed usage data
   - Export last 3 months of billing history

3. Collect application performance metrics:
   - CPU/Memory usage by service
   - Network I/O patterns
   - Storage consumption growth rate

### 2. Analysis
1. Database optimization:
   - Identify slow/expensive queries from pg_stat_statements
   - Analyze index usage and missing indexes
   - Review connection pooling configuration
   - Examine query patterns for potential caching opportunities

2. Infrastructure usage patterns:
   - Map resource consumption to time of day/week
   - Identify peak usage periods vs. idle periods
   - Calculate average vs. peak resource utilization
   - Determine if resources are over-provisioned

3. Cost breakdown by service:
   - Create spreadsheet with costs allocated by:
     - Database (storage, compute)
     - API servers
     - Background workers
     - Storage (S3/spaces)
     - CDN/networking

### 3. Optimization Recommendations
1. Create detailed report with:
   - Current cost breakdown
   - Identified inefficiencies
   - Specific optimization recommendations with estimated savings
   - Implementation complexity assessment

2. Prioritize recommendations by:
   - Potential cost savings
   - Implementation effort
   - Risk assessment

3. Specific areas to investigate:
   - Right-sizing droplets/databases
   - Reserved instances vs. on-demand pricing
   - Autoscaling configuration improvements
   - Database query optimization
   - Caching strategy enhancements
   - Storage lifecycle policies

# Test Strategy:
## Verification Strategy

### 1. Baseline Measurement
1. Document current infrastructure costs:
   - Create spreadsheet with 3-month cost history
   - Calculate average monthly cost by service
   - Identify cost trends (increasing/decreasing)

2. Establish performance baselines:
   - Record current response times for key API endpoints
   - Document database query performance metrics
   - Measure resource utilization percentages

### 2. Validation of Analysis
1. Peer review of collected data:
   - Have another engineer verify data collection methodology
   - Confirm metrics are representative of normal usage
   - Validate cost allocation calculations

2. Test optimization hypotheses:
   - For database optimizations, run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on proposed query changes
   - For infrastructure changes, create test environment with proposed configurations
   - Measure before/after metrics for each recommendation

### 3. Implementation Verification
1. Implement changes in staging environment first:
   - Apply recommended optimizations to staging
   - Monitor for 48-72 hours for stability issues
   - Compare performance metrics to baseline

2. Gradual production rollout:
   - Implement low-risk optimizations first
   - Monitor closely for performance regressions
   - Document actual cost savings vs. projections

3. Long-term monitoring:
   - Create dashboard to track ongoing infrastructure costs
   - Set up alerts for unexpected cost increases
   - Schedule quarterly review of cost optimization opportunities
