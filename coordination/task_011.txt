# Task ID: 11
# Title: Security Hardening & Authentication Enhancement
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive security hardening measures across infrastructure and applications, with immediate focus on demonstrable features for the HPU dental school demo in 7 days, including basic system hardening, MFA implementation, simple RBAC, and security monitoring.
# Details:
1. System Hardening: Apply critical best practices for network, server, application, database, and OS hardening that can be demonstrated in the HPU dental school demo. Focus on visible security improvements like removing unnecessary components, enforcing least privilege, and enabling secure logging.
2. Authentication Enhancement: Implement demonstrable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the demo, with emphasis on user experience and visual security indicators. Prioritize features that healthcare stakeholders can see and understand.
3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Implement a simplified RBAC model for demo purposes, showing clear differentiation between user roles (e.g., admin, dentist, staff) with visually distinct access levels and permissions.
4. Security Monitoring: Set up basic security monitoring with visual dashboards and alerts that can be showcased during the demo to illustrate real-time security awareness.
5. Demo Preparation: Create specific demo scenarios that highlight the implemented security features in a healthcare context, focusing on HIPAA-relevant security controls.

Post-Demo Roadmap (for implementation after the demo):
- API Security: Secure all APIs with authentication, authorization, input validation, and rate limiting.
- Comprehensive Vulnerability Management: Establish regular vulnerability scanning and remediation processes.
- Penetration Testing: Schedule and conduct regular penetration tests.
- Incident Response: Develop and document comprehensive incident response procedures.

Coordinate with HIPAA compliance efforts to ensure all security controls align with regulatory requirements.

# Test Strategy:
- Verify critical systems are hardened with visually demonstrable security controls.
- Test MFA flows that will be shown during the demo, ensuring they work flawlessly.
- Review simplified RBAC implementation by demonstrating different access levels for different roles.
- Test security monitoring dashboards and alerts that will be showcased.
- Conduct demo dry-runs to ensure all security features can be effectively presented to healthcare stakeholders.
- Document visual proof points of security measures for the presentation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct Infrastructure and Asset Discovery [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and inventory all devices, systems, and applications within the healthcare and educational environments to establish a comprehensive attack surface baseline.
### Details:
Utilize automated discovery tools to map network-connected assets, including medical devices, servers, endpoints, and IoT devices. Document unauthorized or unmanaged devices for remediation.

## 2. Assess Current Security Posture and Vulnerabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Evaluate existing security controls, identify vulnerabilities, and assess compliance with healthcare and educational security standards.
### Details:
Perform vulnerability scans, penetration testing, and policy reviews. Prioritize remediation based on risk to patient/student data and critical operations.

## 3. Design and Implement System Hardening Measures [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5
### Description: Apply industry best practices to harden systems, including patch management, secure configurations, and device segmentation.
### Details:
Implement least privilege, disable unnecessary services, enforce strong encryption, and segment networks to isolate sensitive healthcare and educational data.

## 4. Upgrade Authentication Mechanisms with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.6
### Description: Enhance authentication by implementing MFA across all critical systems, tailored to healthcare and educational institution requirements.
### Details:
Select and deploy MFA solutions compatible with clinical workflows and educational access needs. Ensure compliance with HIPAA and FERPA where applicable.

## 5. Design Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a robust RBAC model to ensure users only access data necessary for their roles, following healthcare and educational best practices.
### Details:
Define roles, permissions, and access policies for clinical, administrative, and educational staff. Map roles to least-privilege access and document exceptions.

## 6. Implement and Test RBAC and Security Monitoring Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Deploy RBAC controls and integrate security monitoring solutions to detect and respond to threats in real time.
### Details:
Configure monitoring for unauthorized access, anomalous behavior, and policy violations. Test RBAC enforcement and monitoring alerts in both healthcare and educational contexts.

## 7. Create Demonstrable Security Scenarios for Healthcare Demos [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop demo scenarios that showcase security features, including MFA, RBAC, vulnerability management, and incident response.
### Details:
Script and simulate real-world attack and response scenarios, highlighting compliance, audit trails, and user experience for healthcare stakeholders.

## 8. Develop Post-Demo Roadmap for Long-Term Security [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Outline a strategic plan for ongoing security improvements, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring post-demo.
### Details:
Include timelines, resource requirements, and milestones for continuous improvement, staff training, and regular security assessments.
