# Task ID: 12
# Title: Implement Error Handling & Monitoring
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a comprehensive error handling system with proper logging, user feedback, and monitoring to improve reliability and troubleshooting capabilities, building on the existing performance monitoring foundation.
# Details:
## Existing Performance Monitoring Foundation

- Performance monitoring middleware tracks API response times
- X-Response-Time and X-Timestamp headers added to all API responses
- Slow request logging for requests exceeding 1000ms
- Admin performance endpoints (/admin/performance) with multiple report types
- Structured logging for performance metrics and database operations

## Remaining Implementation Tasks

1. Integrate Sentry for error tracking in both frontend and backend:
```dart
// Flutter integration
void initSentry() {
  Sentry.init(
    (options) {
      options.dsn = 'YOUR_SENTRY_DSN';
      options.tracesSampleRate = 1.0;
    },
  );
}
```

2. Implement structured error logging for message operations:
```dart
void logMessageError(String operation, String messageId, dynamic error) {
  Sentry.captureEvent(
    SentryEvent(
      level: SentryLevel.error,
      message: SentryMessage('Message operation failed'),
      tags: {
        'operation': operation,
        'messageId': messageId,
      },
    ),
  );
}
```

3. Create user-friendly error messages for common failure scenarios:
   - Network connectivity issues
   - Server errors
   - Permission problems
   - Timeout errors

4. Implement graceful degradation for API failures:
   - Offline mode with cached messages
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
   - Fallback to older messages when new ones can't be fetched

5. Extend existing monitoring for additional key metrics:
   - Message delivery success rate
   - Error frequency by type
   - User-reported issues

6. Enhance the existing admin dashboard to include error monitoring alongside performance metrics

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify error events are correctly captured in Sentry
2. Test error handling with simulated API failures
3. Verify user-friendly error messages appear correctly
4. Test offline mode and message caching
5. Verify automatic retry logic works with network fluctuations
6. Test integration between existing performance monitoring and new error tracking
7. Verify enhanced monitoring dashboard shows both performance and error metrics
8. Perform chaos testing by randomly failing different components

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Sentry in Frontend Application [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Sentry SDK in the frontend codebase, configure DSN, and verify error/event reporting.
### Details:
Install @sentry/browser, initialize Sentry with the correct DSN, and test error capture in the frontend application.

## 2. Integrate Sentry in Backend Application [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Sentry SDK in the backend codebase, configure DSN, and verify error/event reporting.
### Details:
Install the appropriate Sentry SDK for the backend language (e.g., Python, Node.js), initialize with DSN, and test error capture in the backend application.

## 3. Implement Structured Logging [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Adopt a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) in both frontend and backend for consistent log output.
### Details:
Configure logging libraries to output logs in a structured format, ensuring logs are easily parsable and can be correlated with Sentry events.

## 4. Develop User Feedback UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a user interface component for collecting feedback and error reports from users.
### Details:
Design and implement a feedback form that can be triggered on error events, optionally integrating with Sentry's user feedback API.

## 5. Implement Offline/Automatic Retry Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Ensure error/event reporting and feedback submission are resilient to network failures by implementing offline storage and retry mechanisms.
### Details:
Store failed submissions locally and retry sending them when connectivity is restored, both for Sentry events and user feedback.

## 6. Add Fallback Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement graceful degradation strategies for error reporting and feedback in case Sentry or network is unavailable.
### Details:
Provide alternative logging or local storage when Sentry is unreachable, and ensure the application remains usable.

## 7. Set Up Monitoring Dashboard and Metric Tracking [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure dashboards for real-time monitoring and track key metrics from logs and Sentry events.
### Details:
Integrate with tools like Sentry dashboards, Grafana, or Kibana to visualize errors, logs, and custom metrics.

## Performance Monitoring Dashboard Foundation Completed

Successfully implemented basic monitoring dashboard infrastructure as part of Phase 1 database performance optimization:

### Admin Performance Endpoints Deployed:
- GET /admin/performance - Performance summary with system info and database status
- GET /admin/performance?type=database - Database statistics and performance metrics
- GET /admin/performance?type=indexes - Index usage analysis showing all 13 applied indexes
- GET /admin/performance?type=full_report - Comprehensive performance report with recommendations

### Monitoring Infrastructure:
- Performance middleware tracks all API response times
- X-Response-Time and X-Timestamp headers added to responses
- Slow request logging for requests exceeding 1000ms
- Structured logging format for performance data
- Real-time performance metrics collection

### Dashboard Features:
- System information (platform, versions, uptime)
- Database performance status and expected improvements
- Index usage statistics and optimization recommendations
- Performance recommendations engine
- Error handling with graceful degradation

Next steps will focus on integrating with Sentry dashboards, Grafana, or Kibana for advanced visualizations and extending with error tracking metrics beyond performance monitoring.

## 8. Conduct Chaos Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Simulate failures and network issues to validate the robustness of error handling, logging, and fallback mechanisms.
### Details:
Perform controlled fault injection to ensure the system handles errors gracefully and all monitoring/feedback mechanisms function as intended.

## 9. Integrate Sentry with Existing Performance Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2
### Description: Connect Sentry error tracking with the existing performance monitoring infrastructure to provide comprehensive observability.
### Details:
Ensure performance metrics from the existing middleware are correlated with Sentry error events. Configure Sentry to capture performance data alongside error information.

## 10. Enhance Admin Dashboard with Error Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.7, 12.9
### Description: Extend the existing admin performance dashboard (/admin/performance) to include error tracking metrics and visualizations.
### Details:
Add error frequency, types, and impact metrics to the existing admin dashboard. Create new report types specifically for error analysis.
