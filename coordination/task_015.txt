# Task ID: 15
# Title: Comprehensive Testing & Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5, 13, 12
# Priority: low
# Description: Create thorough test coverage and documentation for all messaging system changes to ensure reliability and maintainability.
# Details:
1. Write unit tests for core messaging components:
   - MessagesController
   - PollingService
   - ChatRepository
   - Unread message tracking

2. Create integration tests for critical flows:
   - Message sending and persistence
   - Chat deletion/hiding
   - Unread message tracking
   - Error recovery

3. Implement end-to-end tests for key user scenarios:
   - Send message → close app → reopen → verify message exists
   - Delete chat → verify only hidden for current user
   - Receive message → see unread badge → open chat → badge clears

4. Document all API changes:
```markdown
## POST /chat/messages
Sends a new message to a chat room.

### Request Body
```json
{
  "chatId": "string",
  "senderId": "string",
  "content": "string",
  "contentType": "text|image|file"
}
```

### Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "string",
    "status": "sending|sent|delivered|failed",
    "createdAt": "timestamp"
  }
}
```
```

5. Create troubleshooting guide for common issues:
   - Message sending failures
   - Missing messages
   - Unread count discrepancies
   - Chat visibility problems

6. Document database schema changes and migration steps
7. Create performance benchmarks and monitoring guidelines

# Test Strategy:
1. Measure test coverage for all components
2. Verify documentation accuracy with peer review
3. Test troubleshooting guide with simulated issues
4. Conduct user acceptance testing with internal team
5. Verify all tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
6. Test documentation clarity with developers not familiar with the codebase
7. Create regression test suite for future changes
