# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Stripe Payment Integration & Subscription Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate Stripe to enable subscription billing, payment processing, and revenue management, including support for subscription plans, payment methods, billing cycles, invoice generation, payment failure handling, and a customer self-service portal.
# Details:
1. Set up a Stripe account and obtain API keys for both test and production environments.
2. Integrate Stripe's backend SDK (e.g., stripe-node, stripe-python) to securely handle payment requests, create customers, manage subscriptions, and process payments. Implement server-side endpoints for creating payment intents, managing webhooks, and handling subscription lifecycle events (creation, renewal, cancellation, payment failures).
3. Define subscription plans and billing cycles in Stripe Dashboard or via API. Store plan metadata in your application database for reference.
4. On the frontend, use Stripe Elements or Checkout to securely collect payment details and allow users to select or manage their subscription plans. Ensure PCI compliance by never storing raw card data on your servers.
5. Implement webhook handlers to listen for events such as invoice creation, payment succeeded/failed, subscription updates, and cancellations. Update your application's billing state accordingly and notify users of payment issues or changes.
6. Generate and store invoices using Stripe's invoicing features. Provide users with access to their billing history and downloadable invoices.
7. Integrate Stripe's Customer Portal to allow users to manage their payment methods, view invoices, and update subscription details directly.
8. Implement robust error handling and logging for all payment and subscription operations. Ensure that failed payments trigger appropriate retry logic and user notifications.
9. Document the integration and provide admin tools for monitoring revenue, subscription metrics, and payment health.

# Test Strategy:
- Use Stripe's test mode and provided test cards to simulate various payment flows, including successful payments, failed payments, and subscription upgrades/downgrades.
- Verify that users can subscribe, update payment methods, cancel subscriptions, and access billing history through the customer portal.
- Test webhook handling by simulating Stripe events and ensuring your application updates billing status and notifies users correctly.
- Confirm that invoices are generated, stored, and accessible to users.
- Review logs and error handling to ensure all payment failures and edge cases are managed gracefully.
- Perform end-to-end tests for both new and existing users, covering the full subscription lifecycle.
