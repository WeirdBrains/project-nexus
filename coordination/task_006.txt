## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: UI Safety Check (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)
1. Audit all image-related components in the chat interface:
   - ImageMessageBubble
   - ImagePickerModal
   - ImageCropperView
   - ImagePreviewScreen
2. Identify specific causes of layout shifts:
   ```dart
   // Check for missing size constraints in image containers
   Container(
     width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width * 0.7, // Add fixed width
     constraints: BoxConstraints(maxHeight: 300), // Add max height
     child: ImageMessageWidget(message: message),
   )
   ```
3. Add placeholder dimensions during image loading:
   ```dart
   CachedNetworkImage(
     imageUrl: message.imageUrl,
     placeholder: (context, url) => Container(
       width: message.imageWidth ?? 200,
       height: message.imageHeight ?? 200,
       color: Colors.grey[300],
     ),
   )
   ```

### Phase 2: Modal Fixes (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)
1. Refactor ImagePickerModal to use ModalBottomSheet instead of full-screen takeover:
   ```dart
   showModalBottomSheet(
     context: context,
     isScrollControlled: true,
     backgroundColor: Colors.transparent,
     builder: (context) => ImagePickerBottomSheet(),
   );
   ```
2. Implement proper modal dismissal handling:
   ```dart
   // Add WillPopScope to handle back button properly
   WillPopScope(
     onWillPop: () async {
       // Clean up resources before dismissing
       await imagePickerController.dispose();
       return true;
     },
     child: ImagePickerBottomSheet(),
   )
   ```
3. Fix z-index issues with modals appearing behind other UI elements

### Phase 3: Polling Enhancement
1. Modify the PollingService to pause image uploads during app state changes:
   ```dart
   void _handleAppLifecycleChange(AppLifecycleState state) {
     if (state == AppLifecycleState.paused) {
       _pauseActiveImageUploads();
     } else if (state == AppLifecycleState.resumed) {
       _resumeActiveImageUploads();
     }
   }
   ```
2. Implement proper cleanup of image resources when chat view is disposed

### Phase 4: Cropping Fixes (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)
1. Fix the image cropper to maintain aspect ratio correctly:
   ```dart
   ImageCropper(
     aspectRatio: CropAspectRatio(ratioX: 1, ratioY: 1),
     cropStyle: CropStyle.rectangle,
     compressQuality: 85, // Reduce file size while maintaining quality
   )
   ```
2. Add proper error handling for corrupted images or failed cropping operations
3. Implement image size validation before upload to prevent oversized images

### Phase 5: Optimistic UI (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)
1. Implement optimistic image message rendering:
   ```dart
   // Show local image immediately while uploading
   if (message.status == 'sending' && message.localImagePath != null) {
     return Image.file(File(message.localImagePath));
   } else {
     return CachedNetworkImage(imageUrl: message.imageUrl);
   }
   ```
2. Add smooth transitions between local and uploaded images
3. Implement proper fallback UI for failed uploads

### Phase 6: Platform Optimization
1. Add platform-specific image handling for iOS and Android:
   ```dart
   if (Platform.isIOS) {
     // Use iOS-specific image picker options
     final pickedFile = await ImagePicker().pickImage(
       source: ImageSource.gallery,
       imageQuality: 85,
     );
   } else {
     // Use Android-specific image picker options
     final pickedFile = await ImagePicker().pickImage(
       source: ImageSource.gallery,
       imageQuality: 80,
     );
   }
   ```
2. Optimize image caching strategy to reduce memory usage
3. Implement proper image compression before upload to reduce bandwidth usage

## Healthcare Demo Considerations
1. Ensure image sharing appears professional and reliable for healthcare context
2. Prioritize stability over additional features for the Tuesday demo
3. Focus on making the core image sharing workflow flawless
4. Test with realistic healthcare image examples (e.g., document scans, medical diagrams)

# Test Strategy:
## Testing Strategy

### 1. UI Stability Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)
- Create a test suite specifically for layout stability:
  ```dart
  testWidgets('Image message does not cause layout shifts', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Arrange: Set up chat with image messages
    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ChatScreen()));
    
    // Act: Scroll through messages with images
    await tester.drag(find.byType(ListView), const Offset(0, -500));
    await tester.pump();
    
    // Assert: Measure and verify no layout shifts occurred
    final initialLayout = tester.getRect(find.byType(MessageBubble).first);
    await tester.pump(Duration(milliseconds: 500));
    final finalLayout = tester.getRect(find.byType(MessageBubble).first);
    expect(initialLayout, equals(finalLayout));
  });
  ```

### 2. Modal Behavior Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)
- Test modal appearance and dismissal:
  ```dart
  testWidgets('Image picker modal appears and dismisses correctly', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Arrange: Set up chat screen
    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ChatScreen()));
    
    // Act: Tap image attachment button
    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.image));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Assert: Verify modal is visible
    expect(find.byType(ImagePickerBottomSheet), findsOneWidget);
    
    // Act: Dismiss modal
    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.close));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Assert: Verify modal is dismissed
    expect(find.byType(ImagePickerBottomSheet), findsNothing);
  });
  ```

### 3. Cropping Functionality Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)
- Test image cropping with various aspect ratios:
  ```dart
  testWidgets('Image cropper maintains selected aspect ratio', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Arrange: Set up cropper with test image
    final testImage = createTestImage(800, 600);
    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ImageCropperView(image: testImage)));
    
    // Act: Select 1:1 aspect ratio
    await tester.tap(find.text('Square'));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Assert: Verify crop box has correct aspect ratio
    final cropBox = tester.getRect(find.byType(CropBox));
    expect(cropBox.width / cropBox.height, closeTo(1.0, 0.01));
  });
  ```

### 4. State Management Testing
- Test image upload state transitions:
  ```dart
  test('Image message transitions through correct states during upload', () async {
    // Arrange: Set up mock image upload
    final controller = ImageMessageController();
    final mockImage = File('test/resources/test_image.jpg');
    
    // Act: Start upload
    final message = await controller.sendImage(mockImage);
    
    // Assert: Verify initial state
    expect(message.status, equals('sending'));
    expect(message.localImagePath, isNotNull);
    
    // Act: Complete upload
    await completeUpload(message);
    
    // Assert: Verify final state
    expect(message.status, equals('sent'));
    expect(message.imageUrl, isNotNull);
  });
  ```

### 5. Performance Testing
- Measure memory usage during image operations:
  ```dart
  test('Image handling does not cause memory leaks', () async {
    // Arrange: Set up memory tracking
    final memoryBefore = await getApplicationMemoryUsage();
    
    // Act: Perform multiple image operations
    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
      await pickAndProcessImage();
    }
    
    // Force garbage collection
    await triggerGC();
    
    // Assert: Verify memory usage is within acceptable limits
    final memoryAfter = await getApplicationMemoryUsage();
    expect(memoryAfter - memoryBefore, lessThan(10 * 1024 * 1024)); // Less than 10MB increase
  });
  ```

### 6. Integration Testing (URGENT - DEMO PRIORITY)
- End-to-end test of image messaging flow:
  ```dart
  testWidgets('Complete image messaging flow works correctly', (WidgetTester tester) async {
    // Arrange: Set up chat screen with mock services
    await tester.pumpWidget(MaterialApp(home: ChatScreen()));
    
    // Act: Select image
    await tester.tap(find.byIcon(Icons.image));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    await tester.tap(find.text('Gallery'));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Act: Crop image
    await tester.tap(find.text('Crop'));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    await tester.tap(find.text('Done'));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Act: Send image
    await tester.tap(find.text('Send'));
    await tester.pumpAndSettle();
    
    // Assert: Verify image appears in chat
    expect(find.byType(ImageMessageBubble), findsOneWidget);
    
    // Act: Wait for upload to complete
    await tester.pump(Duration(seconds: 2));
    
    // Assert: Verify message status updated correctly
    final messageBubble = find.byType(ImageMessageBubble);
    expect(tester.widget<ImageMessageBubble>(messageBubble).message.status, equals('sent'));
  });
  ```

### 7. Cross-Platform Testing
- Test on both iOS and Android devices to verify platform-specific behavior

TESTING RESULTS: The image message fixes from PR #142 are NOT working as expected during local testing.

Issues Encountered:
1. Authentication system required extensive troubleshooting to get backends properly connected
2. After resolving backend connectivity issues, the core image message problems persist
3. The fixes implemented by the remote agent do not appear to resolve the original UX issues

Current Status:
- ✅ Local testing environment is now properly configured with working authentication
- ✅ Both backends (main and SSO) are running and communicating correctly  
- ❌ Image message shaking, modal takeover, and cropping issues remain unresolved
- ❌ The PR #142 changes did not effectively fix the reported problems

Next Steps Required:
1. Conduct thorough analysis of why the implemented fixes are ineffective
2. Review the actual code changes in PR #142 to identify gaps
3. Develop alternative implementation approach
4. Consider reverting PR #142 and implementing different solution
