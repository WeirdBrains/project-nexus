# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Viral Waitlist System with Referral Mechanics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a viral waitlist system featuring referral tracking, social sharing, gamification, and incentive structures to drive organic user acquisition and maximize viral growth.
# Details:
Design and implement a waitlist module that assigns unique referral codes to each user upon signup. Integrate referral tracking so that when a new user signs up using a referral code, both the referrer and referee are credited appropriately. Build a leaderboard and progress tracker to gamify the experience, allowing users to see their position and progress toward rewards. Implement milestone-based rewards (e.g., after 5, 10, 20 referrals) and automate reward distribution. Integrate social media sharing (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, WhatsApp) with pre-filled messages and referral links to encourage viral sharing. Ensure robust analytics to monitor referral sources, conversion rates, and viral coefficient. Secure the system against abuse (e.g., duplicate signups, bots) using CAPTCHAs and email verification. Provide an admin dashboard for monitoring campaign performance and managing rewards. Consider using proven patterns from platforms like LaunchList, Waitlist, and Prefinery for best practices in viral waitlist design and referral gamification.[1][2][3][4][5]

# Test Strategy:
1. Register multiple users and verify unique referral codes are generated and tracked correctly. 2. Simulate referral signups and confirm both referrer and referee receive appropriate credit and progress updates. 3. Test social sharing buttons to ensure referral links are correctly formatted and tracked across platforms. 4. Validate leaderboard and progress tracker accuracy as referrals accumulate. 5. Trigger milestone rewards and verify automated reward delivery. 6. Attempt duplicate or fraudulent signups to confirm anti-abuse mechanisms work. 7. Review analytics and admin dashboard for accurate real-time data on user growth, referral sources, and campaign performance.
